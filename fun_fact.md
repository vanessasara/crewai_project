Okay, focusing on fun facts about Tokyo *as a city* in general (encompassing some of the areas I mentioned), here are some fun facts:

*   **World's Most Populated Metropolitan Area:** Tokyo and its surrounding areas form the world's most populous metropolitan area, with over 37 million residents. That's more than the entire population of Canada!

*   **Artificial Islands:** Tokyo Bay is home to several artificial islands, including Odaiba, a popular entertainment and shopping district. These islands were created using reclaimed land.

*   **Vending Machine Paradise:** Tokyo has the highest density of vending machines in the world. You can find them selling everything from drinks and snacks to hot meals, toys, and even batteries.

*   **Earthquake Preparedness:** Because Japan is prone to earthquakes, Tokyo's buildings are designed to withstand significant seismic activity. Many buildings have advanced earthquake-resistant features. Drills are also a regular part of life.

*   **The (Former) World's Tallest Structure:** Before the Burj Khalifa, the Tokyo Skytree (built after) became the world's tallest structure when it was completed in 2012 (but not a building, and no longer the tallest structure).

*   **Home to Imperial Palace:** In the heart of Tokyo lies the Imperial Palace, the primary residence of the Emperor of Japan. It's built on the site of the former Edo Castle.

*   **Green Spaces are Hidden Gems:** Despite being a sprawling metropolis, Tokyo has numerous beautiful parks and gardens, like Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden and Ueno Park, offering tranquil escapes from the bustling city.

*   **Fish Capital:** The Tsukiji Outer Market continues to thrive as a major source of fresh seafood and related products. While the inner market (with the tuna auctions) moved to Toyosu, the outer market still offers a vibrant culinary experience.

I tried to keep these general and city-focused. Let me know if you'd like more in any specific area!
